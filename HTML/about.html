        <h2>✨ About Me ✨</h2>
        <p>I’m someone who enjoys the little things in life, calm mornings, good music, and spending time doing things I love. I like expressing myself creatively and always trying new things, whether it’s learning a new skill, exploring new places, or just having meaningful conversations with people.<br>

            In my free time, I enjoy playing the guitar and sitar and listening to music, play badminton, going for walks, and spending time with friends and family. I love capturing moments, and creating things that are meaningful. I’m someone who values growth, positivity, and staying true to myself.</p>
